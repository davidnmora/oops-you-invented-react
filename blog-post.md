It's the 2020s, and React.js is the most popular frontend framework. Everyone's using it. Everyone's hiring for it.

*And everyone has no idea how it really works.*

But not you. Why? Because, way back in 2010, you accidentally invented React...

## It's 2010...
Bieber is in full swing, you definitely don't have a crush on your friend Alejandra, and web dev looks like this:

```html
<div id="root">
   <div class="seconds-container">
      <span class="seconds-number"></span>
      <span style="font-style: italic">seconds</span>
   </div>
</div>

<script>
   var root = document.getElementById('root')
   var secondsNumber = root.getElementsByClassName('seconds-number')[0]
   	
   secondsNumber.innerHTML = (new Date()).getSeconds().toString()
</script>

```
#### Here's what you ‚ù§Ô∏è about it:
1. **HTML** is super declarative: it shows you exactly the structure of the page.
2. **JS** is event-driven & composable. You can update stuff on the fly.

#### And here's what sucks about it: üò§
1. **HTML** is static. And repetitive. Want 20 images? Get ready to copy and paste. Want to update them dynamically based on data? No can do. *Ahh, but isn't that where JS comes into play?* Sure, but it sucks...
2. Writing & executing **JS** feels like being a surgeon who blindly reaches into her HTML patient's body, slices stuff up, and hopes it works.


## Then you have an üí°: let's do everything in JS!

*But can we create HTML elements with only JS?* 

We can!

## ... and it's an imperative, ugly mess üò±

```javascript
const secondsContainer = document.createElement('div')
secondsContainer.setAttribute('class', 'seconds-container')


const secondsNumber = document.createElement('span')
secondsNumber.setAttribute('class', 'year')
secondsNumber.innerText = (new Date()).getSeconds().toString()

secondsContainer.append(secondsNumber)


const secondsText = document.createElement('span')
secondsText.setAttribute('style', 'font-style: italic')
secondsText.innerText = ' seconds'

secondsContainer.append(secondsText)


const root = document.querySelector('#root')
root.append(secondsContainer)
```

<sub>TO CAREFUL READERS: I realize I'm using JS features *not yet available* in 2010 here. I'm just focusing on the big ideas and using familiar, modern syntax. Rest assured this all can be done in pre-ECMAScript 2015, too. :)</sub>

Turns out your üí° wasn't so great. üò•

Then you squint at your code and something hits you -- you're doing 4 things over and over again:
1. creating a DOM element of a certain type
2. setting its properties
3. inserting its children (if needed)
4. ... and appending it an parent element which already exists in the DOM

So let's create a little library that abstract those 4 things! 

You imagine the API should look something like this, with properties like `class` listed as `className` to avoid collision with protected JS `class` keyword and CSS specified as an object with camelCase property names:

```javascript
const props = {
	className: 'seconds-container',
	style: {backgroundColor: 'blue'} 
	/* etc */
}

const secondsContainer = createElement(
   'div',
   props,
   /* any children */
)

render(
   secondsContainer,
   document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

After a few hours, you work out the details of these two functions in a generalized way:

### 1. A function for DOM element creation:

```javascript
const createElement = (tagName, props, ...children) => {
   // (constants and helper functions)
   const PROTECTED_PROP_NAMES = { className: 'class' }
   const kebabifyCase = str => str.replace(/([a-z0-9]|(?=[A-Z]))([A-Z])/g, '$1-$2').toLowerCase()
   const cssifyObject = (object) => Object.keys(object).reduce((accumulator, prop) => `${kebabifyCase(prop)}: ${object[prop]}; `, '')
   
   // Create a new element, unattached to any other elements or the DOM itself
   const element = document.createElement(tagName)

   // Set the elements attributes (called "properties" when the element lives in the DOM, or "props" for short)
   Object.keys(props || {}).forEach(
      propName => {
         const propValue = propName === 'style' ? cssifyObject(props[propName]) : props[propName]
         element.setAttribute(PROTECTED_PROP_NAMES[propName] || propName, propValue)
      }
   )

   // Append any child elements that should exist within this element. These could be just text or an element.
   children.forEach(child => {
      if (typeof(child) === 'string') {
         element.innerHTML += child
      } else {
         element.append(child)
      }
   })

   return element // ... all done!
}
```

### 2. A function to hook your top level element into the existing DOM:

```javascript
const render = (container, root) => root.append(container)
```

Wow, this is starting to feel like a legit library. *What should it be called?* 

This is a "re-hacked" version of web dev, so how about `Rehact.js`?

You split the library in two: `Rehact` for element creation and `RehactDOM` for rendering into the existing DOM*:

 ```javascript
const Rehact = {
   createElement: (tagName, props, ...children) => {/* etc */}
}


const RehactDOM = {
   render: (container, root) => root.append(container)
}
```
<sub>*Astute readers will recognize that ReactDOM was actually split out of React only with the advent of ReactNative and other non-DOM rendering environments.</sub>


And *my!* look how much cleaner your library make your code:

```javascript 
const secondsNumber = Rehact.createElement('span', {className: 'seconds-number'}, [(new Date()).getSeconds().toString()])
const secondsLabel = Rehact.createElement('span', {style: {fontStyle: 'italic'}}, [' seconds'])
const secondsContainer = Rehact.createElement('div', {className: 'seconds-container'}, [secondsNumber, secondsLabel])

RehactDOM.render(
   secondsContainer,
   document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

# Great, you've abstracted away the repetitive details of DOM creation. But can you get the re-usable, declarative feel of HTML?

For example, what if you wanted to use a standard `SecondsContainer` abstraction throughout your codebase?

You decide to wrap `Rehact.createElement` in a simple functions you can re-use, and which are easier to read when nested inside each other similar to HTML:


```javascript
const Text = (props, ...children) => Rehact.createElement('span', props, ...children)
const Container = (props, ...children) => Rehact.createElement('div', props, ...children)

RehactDOM.render(
   Container({className: 'seconds-container',},
      Text({className: 'seconds-number',},
         (new Date()).getSeconds().toString()
      ),
      Text({style: {fontStyle: 'italic'}},
         ' seconds'
      )
   ),
   document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

üëÄ Wahoo! Just as you'd hoped, your JS is now seriously reminding you of the original HTML. The `Container` function wraps its two indented `Text` children, just like `div` did for its `span` children: 

```html
<div class="seconds-container">
   <span class="seconds-number"></span>
   <span style="font-style: italic">seconds</span>
</div>
```

The spirit of HTML now lives in JS! üòÅ ‚ú®

## ... except it's a tangle of parentheses and no one wants to use it.

Including your best friend and coding mentor Alejandra.

**You**: "Alejandra, I re-invented web dev! It's all JS now!"

**Alejandra**: "You mean you wrecked web dev. It's all ugly now."

**You**: "... uh, so what's the best way to send you the Rehact library? your hotmail?"

**Alejandra**: `$('#rehact').forgetIt()`


## Forget Alejandra. She wasn't *that* cool anyway...

But after blocking Alejandra on Myspace (and then un-blocking her to get some debugging help), you realize she was onto something:

#### If the user interface sucks, your product fails.

That goes for websites, devices, and (it turns out) programming libraries.

So you send Alejandra another message:

**You**: "I get that Rehact is a tangle of parens and nested functions. But it's powerful. How might I make it more enjoyable to code with?"

**Alejandra**: "Make it HTML"

**You**: "I hate you"

**Alejandra**: "Anytime"

## Forget Alejandra!!

üò§!

... ü§î ...


##  ... no, wait, actually that's brilliant! üí°

It's *true*: people already know and love HTML. And Rehact is largely just a JS-flavored way of specifying HTML. 

*So what if you let people just write HTML inside your `Rehact` functions*, and then just transpiled it back to valid `Rehact` JS code for execution?

Not only could you let people write HTML elements like `div` or `h2`, but you could also let people represent `Rehact` functions *as if they were HTML*. For example, re-writing `Container({className: 'container'})` as `<Container className="container" />`.

You could call the transpiler `JSH`: JS + HTML. (Or maybe `JSX`, for JS + XML.)

This would be a programming "user interface" that'd make `Rehact` a joy to adopt!

But before you can begin on the `JSX` transpiler, you get a message from Alejandra:

## "Oh, and please stop messaging me on Myspace. It's the 2020s, for gosh sakes get on a platform that's actually relevant."

You freeze.

You've been known to be absent-minded, but how did you accidentally miss *a decade of web dev evolution*?

But surely, even in a decade, no one's thought of something as genius as `Rehact`: it's **declarative**, **component-based**, and easy to **learn once and write anywhere**.

Scanning the web for popular libraries, `React.js` catches your eye, and you open the homepage:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6570507/82911380-af7a0200-9f20-11ea-9095-3da44ce0ab42.png)

Then you scroll down and see:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6570507/82912345-d8e75d80-9f21-11ea-9a0f-7ff1fea45653.png)

you toggle off `JSX` and to your amazement find `React.createElement()` transpiled underneath!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6570507/82921169-eeae5000-9f2c-11ea-95e6-420f66a03b9c.png)

Your head is spinning. You grab distribution links to React, ReactDOM, and JSX, throw it into your Rehact HTML file, delete the 'h' from `Rehact`, refresh your browser and...

### ... everything still works.

```javascript
const Text = (props, ...children) => React.createElement('span', props, ...children)
const Container = (props, ...children) => React.createElement('div', props, ...children)

ReactDOM.render(
   Container({className: 'seconds-container',},
      Text({className: 'seconds-number',},
         (new Date()).getSeconds().toString()
      ),
      Text({style: {fontStyle: 'italic'}},
         ' seconds'
      )
   ),
   document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

## ... even your `JSX` "user interface" idea:

```javascript
const Text = (props) => <span {...props}>{props.children}</span>
const Container = (props) => <div {...props}>{props.children}</div>

ReactDOM.render(
   <Container className="seconds-container">
      <Text className="seconds-number">{(new Date()).getSeconds().toString()}</Text>
      <Text style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>{' seconds'}</Text>
   </Container>,
   document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

You lean back in your chair and smile.

"Oops," you chuckle, "I guess I invented React.js..."

An email notification chimes. Alejandra's inviting you to some platform called "Facebook." You scoff.

*Who needs "Facebook" when you've got `React.js`?*

This post is a distillation of [a talk I gave at an Inland Empire Software Development meetup](https://youtu.be/3MXrYVqYklg?t=37).

The code was directly inspired by [Kent C. Dodds' talk, "The introduction to React you've been missing,"](https://youtu.be/SAIdyBFHfVU) and the story was based loosely off [this account by React's creator](https://youtu.be/5fG_lyNuEAw?t=702) (no, not Dan Abramov, silly)

Please note this article is meant as **an incomplete, rough introduction to React's origin**. While [all the code really works](https://github.com/davidnmora/oops-you-invented-react), it completely skips over many things that were core to its original vision, most glaringly [state management](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html) and React's ["virtual DOM."](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html)

However, omitting class-based components *was* intentional. Let's please forget those ever existed. üòâ [Checkout Hooks for state management and more!](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
